GBM:  Files will be listed in most to least sunward order, unless there is no flare in your time 
interval.  The four most sunward will be highlighted. b0 and b1 are the higher energy BGO detectors; 
b0 is always the sunward one. For CSPEC and CTIME data, spectrum files are daily, rsp files are for 
each solar flare interval. For CTIME data, use the detector response files (.rsp or .rsp2) for 
CSPEC.

LAT:  Spectrum files are daily, rsp files are for each exposure. Select both for your time interval.

KONUS-WIND: Files are for flare intervals. 2012 - ~present are available. The ..._1.pha and 
..._1.rmf files cover 20-1250 keV, ..._2.pha and ..._2.rmf cover 0.25-15.8 MeV. If files 
named..._1_bg.pha and ..._2_bg.pha exist, they contain the background for the corresponding pha file 
(it will be appended to data automatically). You need to copy all of the pha, rmf, and arf files. 
The pha file will be set as input in OSPEX, the corresponding rmf and arf file will be read 
automatically, and the response information inserted directly into the ospex object. You don't need 
to set a response file.  See http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/kwsun/ for usage policy.

MESSENGER:  You need the .dat and .lbl files for each day. Only the .dat file will be listed in the 
Select Input widget.  The .lbl file must be in the same directory as the .dat file. The response 
matrix is computed - there is no response file.

GRS:    FD files are flare data. DB, DA files are day before and day after for background. 
Background save files have been created from the DB, DA files for you - use the o->grs_bk_from_save 
method (or button on Background widget) to automatically find the save file corresponding to the 
input FD file, and set the background from the save file into OSPEX .  Not all flares have a 
background save file usually because there was not enough overlapping data in the FD, DB, DA files. 
The response matrix is computed - there is no response file.

HXRBS:  Files are for flare intervals.  The response matrix is computed - there is no response file.

SOXS:  You need the .les file.  The response matrix is computed - there is no response file. CZT 
and Si data are in same file. After selecting file, a popup will allow you to choose CZT or Si.

MinXSS-1, MinXSS-2 and DAXSS: The data will be either a .sav or .fits file which can be found on the MinXSS data website (https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/minxss/data/) or a similar location. Please verify with the MinXSS/DAXSS Teams. The response matrices are included in ssw and on the MinXSS website. Currently, OSPEX will only display the MinXSS/DAXSS data in the plotman display when NOT in histogram mode.
